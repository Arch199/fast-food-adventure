Our journey began at the American staple KFC, which was doomed to fail from the outset by my challenge to eat 12 Wicked Wings, which I historically don't enjoy. James, however, went with a Zinger Box, a more serviceable order.

The Zinger burger was impressive. The fried chicken gave a nice crunch and was overall better than expected; would recommend. The chicken’s coating lives up to its name with a satisfying but reserved zing. Wings were juicy but not exactly “wicked”. Overall, the wings are probably more enjoyable in a reserved amount.

A group of young lads proudly touting open bottles of beer gave the establishment a lively and inviting atmosphere. The remains of lost chicken strewn across the floor only added to the charm.

## Hungry Jack's

Let’s be real, the “Big Jack” is derivative of Big Mac and suffers from a similar issue in terms of texture and mouthfeel. <insert an entire paragraph describing the mouthfeel in detail> 

But as an overall experience, HJ’s was very underwhelming and pales in comparison in Maccas. Chips were dry, almost stale-tasting. The Big Jack is a proud and disappointing inferior rip-off of the Big Mac. Hungry Jack's seems to be leaning into being just “worse Maccas”, which is an interesting marketing direction, to say the least. In the past, it seems Hungry Jack's made more of an effort to differentiate itself, but now we can say with confidence that “the burgers are *certainly not* better at Hungry Jack's”.

McDonald’s makes Hungry Jack's look pretty bad. The bun on the burger is better, chips are fresher (not even considering the gravy chips, which are in their own league) and crunchier with a softer inside and the meat in the burgersl has a nicer taste with a better bite; which is complimented nicely by the refreshing bits of white onion. Honestly Maccas is the gold standard for us in terms of fast food and left us wanting to go back to try their fancier burgers in the soon to be lost Angus beef range.

Before this review adventure, the difference in quality between Hungry Jack's and Maccas was not really apparent to either of us. James hadn’t been in years and Simon was an occasional patron of the venue who had set his hopes on the mantra that “the burgers are better”. However, after this experience we can assert that there is a clear difference in quality, at least when they directly compete with mainstays such as the quarter pounder and Big Mac.

## Taco Bell

The surplus of sauces was a nice surprise. However, they failed to deliver in terms of spiciness and overall depth of flavour. Portion sizes were on the small side - which was made apparent by the juxtaposition of the gigantic bag holding our 2 meals -  but are reasonable for the price. The main issue for us is that you can essentially make the same thing with a Taco kit from Woolies for much cheaper. That being said, If there were more Taco Bells, we could see the appeal of an Australian Mexican meal on a night out or just for lunch. What would make me go back is the appealing interior of the restaurant, decked out with trendy yellow couches, which beats the other establishments’ decor by many miles.


## Final Ranking

2. Taco Bell
