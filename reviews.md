### James Dyer & Simon Ie

## KFC
Our journey began at the American staple KFC, which was doomed to fail from the outset by my challenge to eat 12 Wicked Wings, which I historically don't enjoy. James, however, went with a Zinger Box, a slightly more serviceable order.

Zinger burger very nice üëç - Chicken gave a nice crunch and was overall better than expected; would recommend. Sauce lives up to its name with a satisfying but reserved zing.
Wings were juicy but not exactly ‚Äúwicked‚Äù.

A group of young lads proudly touting open bottles of beer gave the establishment a lively and inviting atmosphere. The remains of lost chicken strewn across the floor only added to the charm.

## Hungry Jack's
Big Jack derivative of Big Mac - suffers from a similar issue in terms of texture and mouthfeel. <insert an entire paragraph describing the mouthfeel in detail>

Very underwhelming - pales in comparison in Maccas. Chips were dry, almost stale-tasting. The ‚ÄúBig Jack‚Äù is a proud and disappointing inferior rip-off of the Big Mac. Hungry Jack's seems to be leaning into being just ‚Äúworse Maccas‚Äù, which is an interesting marketing direction, to say the least. In the past, it seems Hungry Jack's made more of an effort to differentiate itself, but now we can say with confidence that ‚Äúthe burgers are *certainly not* better at Hungry Jack's‚Äù.

## Maccas
Makes Hungry Jack's look pretty bad. Bun is better, chips are fresher (not even considering the gravy chips, which are in their own league) and crunchier with a softer inside and the meat overall has a nicer taste with a better bite.

Before this review adventure, the difference in quality between Hungry Jack's and Maccas was not really apparent to either of us. James hadn‚Äôt been in years and Simon was an occasional patron of the venue who had set his hopes on the mantra that ‚Äúthe burgers are better‚Äù. However, after this experience we can assert that there is a clear difference in quality, at least when they directly compete with mainstays such as the quarter pounder and Big Mac.

## Taco Bell
Surplus of sauces was a nice surprise. However, they failed to deliver in terms of spiciness and overall depth of flavour. Portion sizes were on the small side, but reasonable for the price. The main issue for us is that you can essentially make the same thing with a Taco kit from Woolies for much cheaper. 

## Final Ranking
1. Maccas
2. Taco Bell
3. KFC
4. Hungry Jack‚Äôs
